        "I'm Ali (known as WaffleAWT), a passionate and self-taught game developer based in Jordan with years of experience crafting games from concept to completion. I started with GameMaker and transitioned to Godot, where I build immersive experiences across genres â€” from atmospheric horror to fast-paced FPS. I excel in creating interconnected game systems, multiplayer functionality, and rich ecosystems.",
        "Beyond development, I produce original soundtracks and sound effects in FL Studio, adding life to every project with carefully crafted music. My skill set spans programming, 3D modeling, pixel art, and animation, allowing me to bring creative visions to life independently or as part of a team.",
        "I'm now focused on releasing my first commercial title, sharing my knowledge through game development tutorials, and continuing to explore new ways to push my creative boundaries.",
        "Let's build something amazing!"
